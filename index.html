<p><strong>Welcome to the Alt Ctrl Bootcamp!</strong></p>

<p>This set of information and tutorials is meant for creative people that want to get started creating hardware interfaces for digital experiences. Specifically, we will be focusing on emulating <em>human interface devices</em> or HIDs. These are a class of interface device that anyone using a computer is already used to and just about any computing system is capable of talking to.</p>

<p>Ok, let&#39;s take a step back from the jargon for a second! What we are talking about are keyboards, mice, joysticks, gamepads, even touch screens! These are <em>interfaces</em> because they allow you, the human, to <em>interface</em> with the machine, to tell it what you want it to do. In fact, I bet you are using one right now!</p>

<p>It is because these devices are so common and how they talk standardized that we can make our <em>own</em> interfaces that <em>pretend</em> to act like them. If you plug a standard USB keyboard into a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer, or even an Android phone or iPhone (with a cheap adaptor likely), it&#39;ll just <em>work</em>. Emulating a HID is borrowing this amazing ability.</p>

<p>This set of tutorials will grow over time, but the initial goal is the same. Give you a path to invest in learning more, including a basic set of parts to buy and starter code that will allow you to focus on some simply wiring, and presto!</p>

<p>If you have any feedback, please head to <a href="jerrytron.com">jerrytron.com</a> and use the contact form.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s get started!</p>
<h1 id='shopping-list'>Shopping List</h1><h2 id='why-do-you-need-all-this-stuff'>Why do you need all this stuff?</h2>
<p>I&#39;ll admit, a tricky part of making building hardware easy is finding a balance between cost, the complexity of tools, and actually having everything you need to get started with as few roadblocks as possible. Some things you might already have laying around, like a micro-usb cable, or at a nearby store, like the wire screw terminals, so feel free to acquire parts however is easiest. This is the best way to save in costs!</p>

<p>The three online stores I frequent to purchase parts are <strong>(Amazon.com)[https://amazon.com]</strong>, <strong>(Sparkfun.com)[https://sparkfun.com]</strong>, and <strong>(Adafruit.com)[https://adafruit.com]</strong>.</p>

<p>You can get this cheaper without the metal legs (or pins), but to easily connect to it you&#39;d then need to buy pins and solder them on.
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Teensy-LC-with-pins/dp/B016MZVBOA/">Teensy LC w/ pins</a> | $22.95 (1 pc.)
You might already have a cable, it just needs to be capable of sending data (like a micro-usb cable used for a phone). |
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-USB-Male-Micro-Cable/dp/B01EK87KW8/">Micro-USB Cable</a> | $8.99 (1 pc.)
Get any breadboard, just no smaller then 400 points (one that looks like this).
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/microtivity-IB400-400-point-Experiment-Breadboard/dp/B0084A7PI8/">Breadboard</a> | $4.99 (1 pc.) |
This is for cutting wire and stripping the end of wire to expose the metal.
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hakko-CSP-30-1-Stripper-Maximum-Capacity/dp/B00FZPHMUG/">Hakko Wire Stripper/Cutter</a> | $11.00 (1 pc.)
Strand wire wraps easily (such as a button lead), solid pushes into breadboards easily (to connect to a Teensy pin). You can also find packs with multiple colors to be more organized, just stick with 22 AWG (the diameter of the wire.) |
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NB3U2BU/">22 AWG Strand Wire - 100ft</a> | $10.00 (1 pc.)
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Remington-Industries-22UL1007SLDBLA-Hook-Up-Diameter/dp/B010T5Y6PU/">22 AWG Solid Wire - 100ft</a> | $9 (1 pc.)
Attach wire together (like strand and solid) with screw terminals. |
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Electrical-Connectors-Terminals-Connection-Assortment/dp/B01MPXUEPO/">Wire Screw Terminals</a> | $9.99 (158 pcs.)
To get started I suggest some sort of arcade buttons, which we will focus on first, but which are totally up to you. A joystick just acts like four buttons.
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/EG-Buttons-Perfect-Fighting-Joystick/dp/B01N5JRU2R/">Mini Arcade Buttons</a> | $11.99 (12 pcs.)
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reyann-Happ-Standard-Arcade-Button/dp/B00V0OM7WO/">Large Arcade Buttons</a> | $12.00 | (6 pcs.)
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Competition-Switchable-Operation-Elliptical-Precision/dp/B01MY8NQEW/">Joystick</a> | $11.99 (1 pc).</p>

<p>There are many ways to peel a potato, so whether it be the best parts to buy, the best way to connect those parts, or the best way to make the code as simple as possible, I think it is important to remember that just getting it all to <em>work</em> is the the victory we are trying to achieve here. You may find a better way to do something, and that&#39;s great! Don&#39;t doubt yourself just because I recommended something different. Once you <em>have</em> gotten something to work, then it&#39;ll be easy to test out your own ideas and see if they work <em>even better</em>.</p>
<h1 id='getting-the-software'>Getting the Software</h1>
<p>There are two pieces of (free) software you&#39;ll need, along with the default code I&#39;ve written for you. Our first battle will be successfully programming your Teensy with the code I provide. Once you&#39;ve succeeded, make sure to take a moment and be proud of this! It isn&#39;t a small thing.</p>
<h2 id='arduino-ide-integrated-development-environment'>Arduino IDE (integrated development environment)</h2>
<p>Follow this link and download the latest version of the Arduino IDE for your operating system.</p>

<p><em>If you are on a Mac, make sure to move the downloaded app to your <strong>Applications</strong> folder.</em>
<em>For Windows, I recommend the Installer version, so follow installation instructions after download.</em>
(<strong>Arduino Download Page</strong>)[https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software]</p>

<p>Got it? Great! Next task!</p>
<h2 id='teensyduino-addon'>Teensyduino Addon</h2>
<p>Again, follow the link and download the version for your operating system. For Windows and Mac you&#39;ll want to double-click the download and run the installer.</p>

<p>(<strong>Teensyduino Download Page</strong>)[https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html]</p>

<p><em>For Mac, it will ask you to <strong>Select Arduino Folder</strong>. Assuming you moved it to the <strong>Applications</strong> folder, you can scroll down until you fine <strong>Arduino.app/</strong>, select it, and click next.</em></p>

<p>Allow it to install all the options it wants and close it once it is complete.</p>

<p>Just one more thing to download!</p>
<h2 id='the-code'>The Code</h2>
<p>This is a direct link, so it will download a zip file to your computer.</p>

<p><a href="keyboard-default-teensylc.zip"><strong>TeensyLC Code Download</strong></a></p>

<p>Find wherever it downloads and unzip the file. It should create a folder called <em>keyboard-default-teensylc</em> with a file inside called <em>keyboard-default-teensylc.ino</em>.</p>

<p>You <strong>must</strong> leave that file in the folder. Arduino requires that the code files (they call them sketches) is always named the same as the folder it in inside.</p>

<p>Nervous yet? Time to fire things up!</p>
<h2 id='uploading-the-code'>Uploading the Code</h2>
<ol>
<li>Hopefully you still have the <em>keyboard-default-teensylc.ino</em> file visible. If not, find it again.</li>
<li>Oh, don&#39;t worry about the code for now. You don&#39;t even need to think about changing the code, not until after we have some buttons working!</li>
<li>Double-click it. That should trigger the Arduino software to open (if it warns you about it being an application downloaded from the internet, just click <em>open</em>).</li>
<li>Find your Teensy and a micro-USB cable.</li>
<li>Plus the small end of the cable into the Teensy, the large end into your computer.</li>
<li>With the Arduino IDE in focus, and the <em>keyboard-default-teensylc.ino</em> file open, you are ready to select the appropriate settings to write the code.</li>
<li>Click the Tools menu, then hover over Boards, and select <strong>Teensy LC</strong>. This should stay the default from now on, but if you are ever having problems, it is worth double checking.</li>
<li>Click the Tools menu, then hover over USB Type, and select Serial + Keyboard + Mouse + Joystick. This should encompass all of the types of controls we will be emulating over the semesters. Again, this should stay default, but if you have problems, double check the setting.</li>
<li>Do you see the check mark in the upper left? And the arrow next to it? If you click the check mark it will try to <em>compile</em> the code and let you know if it is valid. If it isn&#39;t, it&#39;ll spit out some error messages. Clicking the arrow compiles and then tries to put the code on the Teensy.</li>
<li>Let&#39;s start with just verifying the code compiles. Click the check mark! It should be since I already wrote and tested it! Watch the console (the bottom black space), and if all goes well you shouldn&#39;t get any errors.</li>
<li>If you <strong>do</strong> get errors, make sure you set the board type properly (step 6) and the USB type properly (step 7).</li>
<li>Compiled ok (you think)? Let&#39;s try to write the code to the Teensy! It&#39;s time to click the <strong>arrow</strong> in the upper-left next to the check mark.</li>
<li>If it seems to wait and then prints an error in the console like, <em>&quot;Teensy did not respond to a USB-based request to automatically reboot. Please press the PROGRAM MODE BUTTON on your Teensy to upload your sketch.&quot;</em>, try pressing the tiny white button on your Teensy, and click the arrow button again.</li>
<li>If it still doesn&#39;t work, make sure the USB cable is properly connected from the computer to the Teensy.</li>
<li>Still nothing? Try another cable! They are made cheaply and I&#39;ve lost a lot of time on bad cables in the past!</li>
<li>When it <em>does</em> upload to the Teensy, another small application called <em>Teensy</em> might pop open for a moment, or stay open. Don&#39;t worry about this little helper, it is your friend. You can safely close it at any time if you aren&#39;t using the Arduino IDE.</li>
<li>If successful, it should say <em>Done Uploading.</em> on the greenish bar above the console (the bottom dark space with text).</li>
</ol>

<p>Did it work?!? Holy crap! This is huge! Seriously, if you haven&#39;t done much or anything with electronics, getting your environment properly set up to code tiny computers is a big deal! Be proud of yourself because you now have a tiny HID emulator pretending to be a keyboard!</p>

<p>Let&#39;s hook up a button and see something <strong>happen</strong>! After that, we&#39;ll take a step back to learn more about the Teensy and what else we can do with the code, but you deserve to experience the fruits of your labor. &lt;3</p>
