# Shopping List

## Why do you need all this stuff?
I'll admit, a tricky part of making building hardware easy is finding a balance between cost, the complexity of tools, and actually having everything you need to get started with as few roadblocks as possible. Some things you might already have laying around, like a micro-usb cable, or at a nearby store, like the wire screw terminals, so feel free to acquire parts however is easiest. This is the best way to save in costs!

The three online stores I frequent to purchase parts are [**Amazon.com**](https://amazon.com), [**Sparkfun.com**](https://sparkfun.com), and [**Adafruit.com**](https://adafruit.com).

## The Starter List

Item | ~Price
---- | ------
You can get this cheaper without the metal legs (or pins), but to easily connect to it you'd then need to buy pins and solder them on. |
[Teensy LC w/ pins](https://www.amazon.com/Teensy-LC-with-pins/dp/B016MZVBOA/) | $22.95 (1 pc.)
You might already have a cable, it just needs to be capable of sending data (like a micro-usb cable used for a phone). |
[Micro-USB Cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-USB-Male-Micro-Cable/dp/B01EK87KW8/) | $8.99 (1 pc.)
Get any breadboard, just no smaller then 400 points (one that looks like this). |
[Breadboard](https://www.amazon.com/microtivity-IB400-400-point-Experiment-Breadboard/dp/B0084A7PI8/) | $4.99 (1 pc.) |
This is for cutting wire and stripping the end of wire to expose the metal. |
[Hakko Wire Stripper/Cutter](https://www.amazon.com/Hakko-CSP-30-1-Stripper-Maximum-Capacity/dp/B00FZPHMUG/) | $11.00 (1 pc.)
Strand wire wraps easily (such as a button lead), solid pushes into breadboards easily (to connect to a Teensy pin). You can also find packs with multiple colors to be more organized, just stick with 22 AWG (the diameter of the wire.) |
[22 AWG Strand Wire - 100ft](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NB3U2BU/) | $10.00 (1 pc.)
[22 AWG Solid Wire - 100ft](https://www.amazon.com/Remington-Industries-22UL1007SLDBLA-Hook-Up-Diameter/dp/B010T5Y6PU/) | $9 (1 pc.)
Attach wire together (like strand and solid) with screw terminals. |
[Wire Screw Terminals](https://www.amazon.com/Electrical-Connectors-Terminals-Connection-Assortment/dp/B01MPXUEPO/) | $9.99 (158 pcs.)
To get started I suggest some sort of arcade buttons, which we will focus on first, but which are totally up to you. A joystick just acts like four buttons. |
[Mini Arcade Buttons](https://www.amazon.com/EG-Buttons-Perfect-Fighting-Joystick/dp/B01N5JRU2R/) | $11.99 (12 pcs.)
[Large Arcade Buttons](https://www.amazon.com/Reyann-Happ-Standard-Arcade-Button/dp/B00V0OM7WO/) | $12.00 | (6 pcs.)
[Joystick](https://www.amazon.com/Competition-Switchable-Operation-Elliptical-Precision/dp/B01MY8NQEW/) | $11.99 (1 pc).

There are many ways to peel a potato, so whether it be the best parts to buy, the best way to connect those parts, or the best way to make the code as simple as possible, I think it is important to remember that just getting it all to _work_ is the the victory we are trying to achieve here. You may find a better way to do something, and that's great! Don't doubt yourself just because I recommended something different. Once you _have_ gotten something to work, then it'll be easy to test out your own ideas and see if they work _even better_.
