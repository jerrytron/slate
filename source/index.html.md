# Introduction

__Welcome to the Alt Ctrl Bootcamp!__

This set of information and tutorials is meant for creative people that want to get started creating hardware interfaces for digital experiences. Specifically, we will be focusing on emulating _human interface devices_ or HIDs. These are a class of interface device that anyone using a computer is already used to and just about any computing system is capable of talking to.

Ok, let's take a step back from the jargon for a second! What we are talking about are keyboards, mice, joysticks, gamepads, even touch screens! These are _interfaces_ because they allow you, the human, to _interface_ with the machine, to tell it what you want it to do. In fact, I bet you are using one right now!

It is because these devices are so common and how they talk standardized that we can make our _own_ interfaces that _pretend_ to act like them. If you plug a standard USB keyboard into a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer, or even an Android phone or iPhone (with a cheap adaptor likely), it'll just _work_. Emulating a HID is borrowing this amazing ability.

This set of tutorials will grow over time, but the initial goal is the same. Give you a path to invest in learning more, including a basic set of parts to buy and starter code that will allow you to focus on some simply wiring, and presto!
