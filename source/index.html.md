# Introduction

Welcome to the Alt Ctrl Bootcamp! This set of information and tutorials is meant for creative people that want to get started creating hardware interfaces for digital experiences. Specifically, we will be focusing on emulating _human interface devices_ or HIDs. These are a class of interface device that anyone using a computer is already used to and just about any computing system is capable of talking to.

Ok, let's take a step back from the jargon for a second! What we are talking about are keyboards, mice, joysticks, gamepads, even touch screens! These are _interfaces_ because they allow you, the human, to _interface_ with the machine, to tell it what you want it to do. In fact, I bet you are using one right now!

It is because these devices are so common and how they talk standardized that we can make our _own_ interfaces that _pretend_ to act like them.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let kittens = api.kittens.get();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
    "cuteness": 7
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Max",
    "breed": "unknown",
    "fluffiness": 5,
